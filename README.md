# Mobile - Make a weather app

## Requirements

Create an app, which uses an third part api key preferably¬†https://openweathermap.org/¬†to get the weather information of current/selected location and show it in screen.
=> There is no any hard and fast rule on how to and extend of the app. You can make the design as per your wish and need on what you think is best.
¬†
what are the features you might include? (Not necessary though.. but what if) For example
¬†
	1.	Caching of weather information for a 20 mile radius, if already fetched. The duration of cache can be 1 hour and after an hour refetch again instead from cache.
Also push the codebase to a public repo and provide¬†the¬†link¬†to¬†it.


Flutter Version:  3.19.3
